1. **You**: hot make a pdf of result in php 
2. **ChatGPT**: To generate a PDF of the result in PHP, you can use a library like TCPDF or FPDF. Here's a step-by-step guide to help you achieve that:

Step 1: Install the TCPDF library (or any other PDF library you prefer) in your PHP project. You can either download it from the official website or use composer to manage your dependencies.

Step 2: Include the TCPDF library in your PHP file by adding the following line at the top:

```php
require_once('path/to/tcpdf/tcpdf.php');
```

Step 3: Create a new TCPDF object:

```php
$pdf = new TCPDF('P', 'mm', 'A4', true, 'UTF-8');
```

Here, 'P' represents the page orientation (Portrait), 'mm' is the unit of measurement, 'A4' is the page size, and 'UTF-8' is the character set.

Step 4: Set the document information, such as the title, author, and subject:

```php
$pdf->SetCreator('Your Name');
$pdf->SetAuthor('Your Name');
$pdf->SetTitle('PDF Title');
$pdf->SetSubject('PDF Subject');
```

Step 5: Add a new page to the PDF:

```php
$pdf->AddPage();
```

Step 6: Write your content to the PDF using methods provided by the library. For example, you can add a header, footer, and text:

```php
$pdf->SetHeaderData('', 0, 'PDF Header', 'PDF Header', array(0, 0, 0), array(255, 255, 255));
$pdf->setFooterData(array(0, 0, 0), array(255, 255, 255));
$pdf->SetFont('times', '', 12);
$pdf->Cell(0, 10, 'PDF Content', 0, 1);
```

Here, you can customize the header and footer as per your requirements. The `SetFont()` method sets the font family, style, and size. The `Cell()` method is used to add text to the PDF.

Step 7: Output the generated PDF to the browser or save it to a file:

```php
$pdf->Output('result.pdf', 'D');
```

The second parameter of the `Output()` method determines the output destination. In this example, `'D'` means the PDF will be sent to the browser and the user will be prompted to download it. You can also use `'F'` to save the PDF directly to a file.

That's it! You now have a PDF generated with your PHP code using the TCPDF library. Remember to adjust the content and formatting according to your specific requirements.
